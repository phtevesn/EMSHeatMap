# Problem Statement
When responding to emergencies, every second counts. First responders need to be able to quickly get to the 
scene of an emergency.  This is where the EMS Predictor comes in.  This application will create a heatmap that 
shows the display areas that are at risk of being hit by an emergency. 

---

# Proposed Solution
An open-source, real-time heat map platform that visualizes the predicted volume and distribution of emergency services needs accross a geographical area given various data from previous emergencies and taking into account changing variables such as weather. This program will also categorize data by incident type, time, and location, providing actionable insights for multiple stakeholders.

# Competetors 
The City of Costa Mesa California has a similar open-source product that displays types of incidents throughout the city and some details about the incident but has a narrower data set, ranging from the previous 24 hours to the last 14 days. This map will show all incidents recorded and where it has happened requiring viewers to find a conclusion for themselves given the data shown on the map. Our product will compile data from a much larger scope and from multiple avenues of information allowing for predictive heat map of the city to be produced, indentifying areas that may be prone to incidents, allowing the everyday consumer to make safe decicions and first responders to be prepared for potential emergencies.
